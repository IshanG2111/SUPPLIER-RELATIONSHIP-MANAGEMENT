# SRM Portal — Step-by-Step User Testing Guide
## Automated Procurement Lifecycle Simulator

Welcome to the Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) Portal! What you are testing is a digital version of how enterprise companies (such as Tata Motors, Amazon, Infosys, and Samsung) manage their **Procurement Lifecycle** in real life. 

Instead of exchanging fragmented emails, manually typing in data, and losing track of billing invoices, this portal automates the entire supply chain. Our **Client-Side PDF Parsing** simulates how modern ERP systems (like SAP Ariba, Coupa, or Oracle Procurement) automate manual data entry.

* **Action**: Sourcing Manager prepares to draft a request.

---

### STEP 2 — Admin Creates the RFQ (Request for Quotation)
* **DFD Process**: 2.2 RFQ Management | **Actor**: Admin (Sourcing Manager)
* **Actions**:

  6. **UI Verification**: Confirm the modal expands to `xxl` (1280px wide) split-screen showing the PDF viewer on the right and form fields on the left.

     * *Title*: `Rfq procurement spec` (derived from filename)
     * *Category*: `Logistics` (matched via text keywords)
     * *Deadline*: `2026-08-30` (matched via date regex)
     * *Target value*: `450000` (matched via estimated budget regex)

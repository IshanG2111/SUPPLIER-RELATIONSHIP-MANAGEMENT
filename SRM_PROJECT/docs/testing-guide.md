# SRM Portal — Step-by-Step User Testing Guide
## Automated Procurement Lifecycle Simulator

Welcome to the Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) Portal! What you are testing is a digital version of how enterprise companies (such as Tata Motors, Amazon, Infosys, and Samsung) manage their **Procurement Lifecycle** in real life. 

Instead of exchanging fragmented emails, manually typing in data, and losing track of billing invoices, this portal automates the entire supply chain. Our **Client-Side PDF Parsing** simulates how modern ERP systems (like SAP Ariba, Coupa, or Oracle Procurement) automate manual data entry.

> [!TIP]
> **Isolated Multi-Account Testing (Tab Independence):**
> The active user session is stored in `sessionStorage`, which is isolated per browser tab. This enables you to open the supplier portal in Tab A as one supplier, and log in to a second supplier account in Tab B, allowing you to test independent supplier behaviors simultaneously in the same browser window without session conflicts.

## The 13-Step End-to-End Testing Flow

Follow these steps sequentially to test the full Procurement Lifecycle.

---

### STEP 0 — Supplier Registers Product Catalog (Master SKU Data)
* **Business Context**: Before bidding on sourcing requests, suppliers manage their unique SKU catalogs of offerings to showcase their capabilities and price guidelines to the procurement team.
* **Actions**:
  1. Open the portal, click **Login**, select **Supplier Portal**, and log in (e.g., using default supplier session showing company **Apex Industrial Components**).
  2. Navigate to **Product Catalog** in the sidebar.
  3. Verify the default items (Apex should see mechanical parts like *Hydraulic Valve Assembly*).
  4. Click **Add offering** at the top right, fill in a new offering (e.g. SKU: `PRD-4409`, Offering: "Titanium Valve", Category: "Mechanical", Capacity: `500`, Price: `85000` INR), and save it.
  5. Open the Supplier Portal representing a different company (e.g. **Vector Packaging Co.**) in another tab and verify they see their own catalog (packaging film, etc.) and do *not* see Apex's "Titanium Valve".
  6. Switch to the **Admin Console** and navigate to **Product Management** under *Procurement* in the sidebar.
  7. **UI Verification**: Use the **Supplier Dropdown** selector at the top right:
     * Select **Apex Industrial Components**: Confirm the Admin sees the newly added `PRD-4409` "Titanium Valve".
     * Select **Vector Packaging Co.**: Confirm the Admin sees only Vector's packaging catalog.
  8. Go back to the **Supplier Portal** for Apex, click the red trash icon to soft-delete the item, and verify it disappears from the Admin's list for Apex in real-time.

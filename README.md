    ## 🚀 Key Modules & Features

    ### 1. 🔐 Role-Based Authentication System
    *   **Dual Entry Gateways**: Fully styled custom entry portals for **Suppliers** and **Admins**.
    *   **Iridescent Globe Visualization**: An elegant, dynamic SVG globe animating interactive nodes and connection pulse lines on the presentation pane.
    *   **Transition Magic**: Powered by **Framer Motion** for springy role switches, interactive hover states, card lifting, and floating transitions.
    *   **Guided Registration**: A 3-step create-account flow that collects account details, business/department details, and verification in sequence.
    *   **Tab Independence**: Uses `sessionStorage` to isolate user sessions per browser tab. You can test admin workflows in Tab A and supplier workflows in Tab B simultaneously without session conflicts.

    ### 2. 🛡️ Admin Portal (Procurement Control Center)
    Provides administrators with complete control and visibility over the supply chain:
    *   **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time analytical breakdown of total supplier participation, purchase commitments, and average RFQ cycle times.
    *   **RFQ Sourcing**: Dynamic forms to author and broadcast RFQs instantly. Auto-fills fields by parsing uploaded PDF specs side-by-side.
    *   **Advanced Bid Comparison**: Interactive charts (Recharts) comparing multiple supplier bids per RFQ side-by-side to determine the best price and quality metrics.
    *   **Purchase Orders (PO)**: Manage PO pipelines, track order status, and issue agreements.
    *   **Receipts & Reviews (GRN)**: Record Goods Receipt Notes (GRN) to check quantities and inspect deliveries. Integrates a multi-item grid parsed from delivery receipts.
    *   **Invoice Approval workbench**: Review invoices, check a 3-way match (PO vs GRN vs Invoice), and record payouts.
    *   **Governance & Audit Trail**: Monitor system logs to inspect chronological action trails for security.

    ### 3. 🚚 Supplier Portal (Partner Workspace)
    Empowers suppliers to manage quotations, products, and fulfillment:
    *   **Supplier Dashboard**: View active bids, delivery rates, and performance statistics.
    *   **RFQ Sourcing Inbox**: Search, filter, and bid directly on open Requests for Quotations (RFQs).
    *   **Product Catalog Management**: Easily list, edit, and keep track of supplier items.
    *   **Order & Delivery Tracker**: Live statuses of ongoing purchase orders, shipments, and invoice histories.
    *   **KPI & Performance Metrics**: Real-time ratings and scorecards evaluating delivery, pricing, and quality.
    *   **Compliance Uploads**: Keep credentials active by uploading ISO Certificates or W-9 tax forms, automatically parsed for expiry dates.

    ### 4. 🔔 Premium Real-Time Multi-Event Toast Notification System
    *   **Animated Entries & Exits**: Premium sliding/fading card animations powered by **Framer Motion** for a sleek, high-end feel.
    *   **Dynamic Styling & Categorization**: Context-aware color palettes, typography, and iconography representing Sourcing (RFQs, Bids), Orders (POs, GRNs), and Negotiations (Messages, counter-offers).
    *   **Auto-Dismissal & Interactivity**: Automatically fades out in 5 seconds or allows click-to-dismiss. Hover states and transition cards are fully interactive.
    *   **Intelligent Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Uses `localStorage` change tracking and browser `storage` events to broadcast and display alerts instantly across multiple open tabs or windows.
    *   **One-Click Deep Linking**: Clicking a toast marks the notification as read in the database, and automatically routes the user directly to the Sourcing or Supplier Notifications page.

    ## ⚡ Client-Side PDF Parsing Engine

    The portal eliminates manual data entry by extracting metadata from business documents entirely within the user's browser. 

    ```
    [PDF Uploaded] ──> [Dynamic CDN Loader (pdf.js)] ──> [Text Extraction] ──> [Regex Parsers] ──> [Form Auto-Fill]
    ```

    ### Module Parsing Details
    1.  **RFQ Specification PDF** (`parseRfqPdf`): Extracts title, category (Logistics, Facilities, Services, Manufacturing), deadline, and estimated budget.
    2.  **Bid Quotation PDF** (`parseBidPdf`): Extracts bid package reference, warranty, delivery time, and total price. Uses strict word boundaries (`\btotal\b`) to avoid extracting individual line-item unit prices (e.g. `$18.50`) instead of the grand total bid (e.g. `$125,000`).
    3.  **Delivery Receipt PDF** (`parseGrnPdf`): Multi-item table-row parser extracts and sums individual quantities (Delivered/Accepted) from parsed columns.
    4.  **Commercial Invoice PDF** (`parseInvoicePdf`): Extracts invoice ID, PO number, and invoice amount using strict boundary matches.
    5.  **Compliance Document PDF** (`parseCompliancePdf`): Extracts certification ID, expiry date, issuer, and document type.

    ### UI Layout Sizing & Verification Window Behavior
    The modals resize dynamically depending on whether a PDF preview is active to display a clean, side-by-side verification screen:
    *   **Standard View (No PDF)**: Modals open centered at standard width (`lg` - 768px or `xl` - 1024px).
    *   **Split-Screen View (With PDF)**: Modals automatically expand to `xxl` (`max-w-7xl` / 1280px). The left pane renders editable input fields populated by the parser, while the right pane renders an interactive PDF preview `iframe`, enabling quick verification prior to saving.

    ## 🛡️ Security & Vulnerability Auditing

    The portal is audited and patched against common enterprise vulnerabilities:

    *   **SQL Injection (SQLi) Prevention**: All dynamic database interactions in the PHP REST APIs use MySQLi prepared statements. Input parameters are bound strictly as literals, making SQL injection impossible.
    *   **Password Security**: User passwords are securely stored on the local database using standard **bcrypt** hashing (`password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT)`).
    *   **In-Browser Document Privacy**: PDF text extraction and parsing occur entirely in-memory within the client's browser. No document binary or parsed text is transmitted to external server APIs, ensuring compliance with data privacy policies.
    *   **Critical Parameter Binding Patches**:
        *   `bids.php`: Remediated a parameter count mismatch where 14 type specifiers were declared for 13 bound variables.
        *   `receipts.php`: Resolved scrambled type mappings (`'sssiiisssii'`) which bound string fields to integer parameters, preventing database write corruptions.
        *   `invoices.php`: Corrected date parameter double-casting where date string fields were bound as doubles (`d`), causing dates to truncate to `2026-00-00`. They are now safely bound as string literals (`s`).
